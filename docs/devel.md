# Architecture:

## Project structure

This project follows the conventions presented in the [standard Golang
project](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout).

This project use `kubebuilder` for scaffolding.  http://kubebuilder.netlify.com/quick_start.html

We also use everywhere `Makefile` targets for simplify the workflow, in dev., testing and ci/deployment.

# Devel

## Dependencies

* `go >= 1.11`

#### Bumping the Kubernetes version used by `registries-operator`

Update the constraints in [`go.mod`](../go.mod).

## Building

A simple `make` should be enough. This should compile [the main
function](../cmd/registries-operator/main.go) and generate a `registries-operator` binary as
well as a _Docker_ image.

## Running `registries-operator` in your Development Environment

There are multiple ways you can run the `registries-operator` for bootstrapping
and managing your Kubernetes cluster:

### ... in your local machine

You can run the `registries-operator` container locally with a
`make KUBECONFIG=my-kubeconfig local-run`. This will:

  * build the `registries-operator` image
  * run it locally  using  `my-kubeconfig` to connect to the kubernetes cluster

For running the operator locally you must ensure that it access the kubernetes
api with privileges for mounting the /etc/docker host volume, like in the psp
fragment below:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
spec:
  volumes:
    # Kubernetes Host Volume Types
    - hostPath
  allowedHostPaths:
    - pathPrefix: /etc/docker
```

# Testing

What we cover here:

- workflow
- design/goals
- why do we use travis and circleci 

## Workflow:

### Prerequisites:

We assume that you have already have a running cluster with the `KUBECONFIG` env variable set.
You can use `kind` for deploying a cluster or another method of your choice.


* Integration Tests

`make integration` will run the integration tests against a running cluster
pointed by the KUBECONFIG environment variable. 

The integration tests do not work against the test environment provided by
kubebuilder as they require information about the cluster's nodes, which is
not provided by kubebuilder.

* e2e-tests: 
`make e2e-tests` will run e2e tests. This tests are run also in CI with `kind`.


## Key design and goals:

### Local == Remote

This project use everywhere Make targets.
In this way when we run `make test` locally or on CI remotely, there is no difference.
The goal is that for an user/dev should be not differnce to run locally or what is run by CI.

### Makefile is the api

As stated before, the Makefile targets is where other integration tools are dependent for.

In this way we can remove/change the internal logic without modifying the API, and braeking external deps.

## Why do we use Travis and circleCI?

The golden rule is: We use Travis only for `end to end tests` and for the rest we use circleci.
Since `kind` doesn't work in CircleCI because of network isolation, we use travis only for `e2e` tests.
